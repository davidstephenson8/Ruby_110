this was my way of changing suits and values the template while keeping
cyclomatic complexity down. #value_swap and #ten_swap were in the
#generate_pretty_card
method. I couldn't figure out a way to get all of this done without all of
these branches. I tried an implementation with #map and []= assigning card
templates that only needed 4 else/if statements but it was mutating my
card_template array and I couldn't figure out a way to not do that.
so the generate_pretty_card method looked something like

def generate_pretty_card(card, crd_template)
  pretty_card = crd_template.map do |line|
    if line.include?("S")
      line[line.index("S")] = suit
    elsif line.include?("_") && value == "10"
      line[line.index("_")] = "1"
    elsif line.include?("_")
      line[line.index("_")] = " "
    elsif line.include?("N") && value == "10"
      line[line.index("N")] = "0"
    elsif line.include?("N")
      line[line.index("N")] = value
    end
  end
end

And then the card template would be mutated, so it'd get the first card right
but would run the method and wouldn't change to the other cards because
it wasn't running into the right stuff. Hard coding the spots in the template
to put things just seemed a little cheaty. Like saying suit goes
in card_template[1][2] and card_template[5][7] put it there every time
seems not ideal. You can be more flexible with the card design if you
just have the markers that the program's looking for instead of hard
coding a spot. If you change card size ever you have to rewrite everything.

What are your thoughts?

There's probably a better way to do all of this but I've spent a lot of time
puzzling over this and getting something that rubocop accepts and works in
the game feels like an accomplishment for now.
